#  Practical 6 Reflection: Token-Based Authentication (Email & Password)

## Final Thoughts

The most important lesson from this practical is that *security must be embedded into every layer* of a system — from how passwords are stored to how tokens are verified, to how errors are handled. It’s not an optional add-on but a fundamental design principle.

The real value came from building a fully functional authentication system using *email/password login, implementing **JWT-based stateless authentication, and securing access through **middleware* — all while following industry-standard best practices.

##  Future Improvements

Based on what I learned and implemented, I see opportunities to enhance the system with:

1. *Refresh tokens* for session continuity
2. *Rate limiting* to prevent abuse and brute force attacks
3. *Email verification* for account activation
4. *Stronger password policies* to improve user security
5. *Audit logging* for tracking suspicious authentication attempts
6. *Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)* for sensitive accounts

##  Key Insights

###  1. Security Is Multi-Layered

Security involves much more than hashing passwords:

* Input validation
* Rate limiting
* Secure headers and HTTPS
* Opaque and generic error responses

###  2. Dev Experience Matters

A good authentication system is also developer- and user-friendly:

* Proper token expiry
* Helpful but safe error messages
* Strong TypeScript support to catch issues early

###  3. Stateless Auth With JWT

JWTs are great for distributed, scalable systems:

* No need for server-side session storage
* Easily shareable across services or mobile apps
* Efficient for SPAs and microservices

###  4. Use Standards, Not Shortcuts

Using trusted standards is non-negotiable:

* JWT (RFC 7519) for token formatting
* Bcrypt for hashing passwords securely
* Correct use of HTTP status codes for clarity and security

##  Challenges and How I Solved Them

###  Challenge 1: JWT Structure Confusion

*Issue*: Uncertainty about what data should be in the token payload
*Fix: Researched best practices and learned that JWTs are **not encrypted*—only signed—so payloads must be minimal and non-sensitive.

---

###  Challenge 2: Secure Error Responses

*Issue*: Initial errors leaked too much info (e.g. whether an email existed)
*Fix: Used **generic error messages* and *uniform timing* to prevent attackers from gaining insight.

---

###  Challenge 3: TypeScript and Middleware

*Issue*: Trouble accessing JWT payload in Hono’s middleware due to type errors
*Fix*: Imported JwtVariables and declared custom context types for clean, type-safe middleware logic.

---

###  Challenge 4: Schema Migration

*Issue*: Needed to add hashed password field without breaking the DB
*Fix*: Used bunx prisma db push and generate to safely update the schema and regenerate types.

---

##  What I Learned

###  Security Principles

* Never store plain text passwords
* Bcrypt and salt rounds make password hashing secure and slow for attackers
* JWTs ensure token integrity, not confidentiality

###  Auth Flow Design

Built a complete lifecycle:

1. Register → hash password → store user
2. Login → verify → return signed token
3. Auth middleware → decode → authorize route access

###  Middleware Magic

* One source of truth for token validation
* Cleanly separates logic concerns
* Reusable and scalable

###  Database Design

* Prisma made relationship handling and query optimization easy
* One-to-many user-account relationship supported clean structure

---

##  Documentation Summary

###  Core Concepts

#### 1. Authentication vs Authorization

* *Authentication* = Who are you?
* *Authorization* = What are you allowed to do?

*Example*:

* Passport = Authentication
* Boarding pass = Authorization

---

#### 2. Password Security with Bcrypt

* Never store raw passwords
* Bcrypt uses salt + cost factor
* Hashes can be compared, not reversed

---

#### 3. JWT (JSON Web Token)

* Stateless, signed tokens: Header.Payload.Signature
* Payload holds user ID (sub) and expiry (exp)
* Signed with secret key for integrity

---

#### 4. Middleware Pattern

* Used in protected routes
* Verifies token before business logic runs
* Promotes clean, DRY code

---

#### 5. Database Relationships

* One user → many accounts
* Enforced with foreign key constraints
* Prisma ORM simplifies management and querying

This practical laid a solid foundation in authentication system design. It connected theoretical security principles with real-world implementation from how to store user credentials safely, to how to manage access using stateless tokens, and how to structure a secure backend that scales.
